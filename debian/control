Description: Python flamegraph profiling tool
 Pyflame is a novel Python profiling tool that uses ptrace(2) to instrument
 processes. It is capable of attaching to already-running processes, or
 profiling new processes from the start, much like strace. Pyflame emits data in
 the standard flamegraph format.
